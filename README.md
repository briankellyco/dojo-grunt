# dojo-grunt

I created this application to provide the development team with a harness that they could use to build and test dashboard widgets. The dashboard widgets all ran in a dojoToolkit environment.

Yeoman was leveraged at the beginning to provide a skeleton framework for the grunt build file. 

The application utilises grunt, bower, livereload and dojo.

Run the application with:  
	bower install  
	npm update  
	grunt
